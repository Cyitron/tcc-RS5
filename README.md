# PUCRS-RV

### Description 

PUCRS-RV is a processor that implements the RISC-V 32 bits integer Module (RV32I). It was written in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) called SystemVerilog.

This project was designed at the Embedded Systems Group (GSE) of the polytechnic school, PUCRS, Brazil.

The processor is a 5 stage pipeline, synchronized to the rising edge of clock. The stages are:

- Fetch: Contains the Program Counter (PC) Logic, that indexes the Instruction memory.
- Decoder: Decodes the instruction, extracting it's type, format, operantion and register addresses.
- Operand Fetch: Fetches the operands in the register Bank and performs data hazards detections. When a hazard is detected, it insert bubbles until the conflict has been solved.
- Execute: Performs the given operation on the received operands. It has 6 units where each one is responsible for one kind of operation, such as shift operantions are performed in "Shift Unit" or memory instructions are performed by "Memory Unit".
- Retire: Make the retirement of the instructions, it can be a write-back in register bank, or performing a write in data memory or performing a branch.

## Requirements

To perform code compilation the RISC-V toolchain is needed. The toolchain has a compiler that performs the compilation of the applications codes that are written in C language and generates a binary, this binary is the entry of the processor simulation. The applications are located in [app/](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/app).

The installation of the toolchain is only needed if you want to compile new applications or change parameters in the given ones, the given applications are already compiled and it's binarys are located in the folder [bin/](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/bin).

To install the Toolchain a guide and a script are provided inside the folder [tools/riscv-toolchain](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/tools/riscv-toolchain).

To perform the simulation you must have a HDL simulator (e.g. ISE, MODELSIM). To perform the simulation of a specific application, you must edit the binary input file in the [ram.sv](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/blob/master/sim/ram.sv) (the line to be edited is inside the "initial" block and is located in the line 54. The tesbench and the ram implementation are located in the [/sim](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/blob/master/sim/) folder. Once the desired application is selected and the testbench is pointing to it, then you are able to perform the simulation using the HDL simulator.

## Applications
In this repository we provide some applications that were used to validate the processor. The source codes of the applications are located the [app/](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/app) folder, all of them can be built using their own Makefile, it will generate the output binary of each application. We recommend moving it to the [bin/](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/bin) folder using a cp command. Inside the [bin/](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/bin) folder all the given applications are already compiled and ready to simulate its behaviour.

### Coremark
The [Coremark](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/app/coremark) is a Benchmark application that was develop by EEMBC, it was ported to run in PUCRS-RV and can be compiled by simply running the command "make" insede Coremark's folder, it will then generate a binary called "coremark.bin". In our processor since we have only one thread we are running the coremark for only one iteration.

### RISCV Tests
The [riscv-tests](https://github.com/marlls1989/riscv-tests/tree/159079a82ecc332ce32e5db84aff9f814dc7ec12) is the "Berkeley Suite" that was developed to validate the RISC-V implementations. It tests all the instructions by running comparisons between the expected results and those generated by the Unit under verification.

### Sample Codes
The [samplecode](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/tree/master/app/samplecode) folder contains some simple applications that were used to test some functionalities in the processor. These applications use the BareOS, that is a simple Operational System. All the applications are compiled at once by simple running "make" command. To add more applications you must insert in the folder the source code in C language and then edit the [Makefile](https://github.com/Willian-Nunes/pucrs-rv/blob/master/app/samplecode/Makefile) so it also compiles the new application, to do that, is just needed to edit the line 13 of the Makefile by adding the name of the new application on the "PROGNAME" variable, that is a list of the applications that will be make.

The applications provided are:
1. Dummy - Test the halt function of the processor.
2. Hello World - Test the "stdout" of the processor, by printing "Hello World".
3. Hanoi Tower - Implements a Hanoi Tower solving algoritm.
